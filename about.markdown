#### **_<span style="color:grey; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:5;">*It's currently under construction*</span>_**



Welcome to my website! I am a Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia ([UBC](https://www.ubc.ca)). 

I started my study at UBC in 2017 Fall and expect to finish it in 2024 May. I have taken a two year long academic leave from 2019 to 2021 in order to complete my military obligation back home (Republic of Korea). I will be entering Year 3 at UBC (2021 Fall). I am excited to return to school!
