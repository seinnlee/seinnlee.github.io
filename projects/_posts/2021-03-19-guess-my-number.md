It has been a while since I coded in anything let alone Java due to my _military obligation_. To refresh my Java and UBC CPSC 210 (Software Construction) knowledge, I created a simple guessing numbe game in Java. It only works with Scanner class input at the moment, but will soon be updated with GUI.
